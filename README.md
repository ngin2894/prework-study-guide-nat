## Description
    This is an online study guide that I created for a coding bootcamp I am taking. This guide acts as a reference for key notes and skills I will need to be successful as a developer. It also functions as a way to apply my learnings practically as I learn new skills in the course. 

    This guide gave me the basic skills to use HTML, Github, CSS, and Javascript.
